 A high-level view about the NCTUns 1.0 network simulator

 Support for Various Networks - wired networks with fixed nodes and point-to-point links
   wireless networks with mobile nodes and IEEE 802.11 (b)
   wireless network interfaces

 Support for Various Networking Devices - Ethernet hubs, switches, routers, hosts, 
   IEEE 802.11 wireless access points and interfaces

 Support for Various Network Protocols - IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD MAC, IEEE 802.11 (b)
   CSMA/CA MAC, learning bridge, spanning tree, IP, RIP, OSPF, UDP, TCP, HTTP, FTP, Telnet


 High-Level Structure - Important modules 
   GUI
     drawing network topologies
     configuring the protocol modules used inside a node
     specifying the moving path of mobile nodes
     plotting network performance graphs
     playing back the animation of a logged packet transfer trace

   simulation job dispatcher -  manage and use multiple simulation servers at the same time
     to increase aggregate simulation throughput
     (Server)
   coordinator - coordinator process is alive as long as the simulation machine is alive
     coordinator will register itself with the dispatcher to join the dispatcher's simulation machine
     coordinator forks a simulation server process to simulate the specified network and protocols to execute a job
     communicate with the dispatcher and the GUI program on behalf of the simulation server process
     Message exchanges between the simulation server process and the GUI program done via the coordinator


   So which process do you run first? dispatcher or coordinator?


 submit simulation job to a specified dispatcher
 dispatcher will then forward the job to an available simulation server for execution
 The server running the simulation engine will process (simulate) the job
   return the results back to the remote GUI program for further analyses


 Starting Screen

 Components
   Topology Editor
   Attribute Dialog Box - double-click the icon of the network node
   Performance Monitor - graphically generate and display the plots of monitored performance metrics over time
     data is in plain-text
     can be used to plot graphs from data generated by other application programs also

   Node Editor - configure the protocol
   Packet Animation Player - visually debug and test the behavior of a network protocol

 
 Install the NCTUns 1.0 network simulator package   
 
 Tailor made for Fedora

 Gets installed in /usr/local/nctuns/bin
 Has executable programs of the GUI program, dispatcher, coordinator, and the simulation engine
 Named nctunsclient, dispatcher, coordinator, and nctunsse, respectively

 /usr/local/nctuns/tools stores executable programs like tcpdump, stg, rtg, ifconfig
  
   
 dnf install git gcc-c++

 Carefully read the “README” 

 git clone https://github.com/jorgenio/nctuns.git
 or 
 Download from git clone https://github.com/jorgenio/nctuns.git , then unzip

 cd nctuns/NCTUns-6.0/

 run the install.sh
   ./install.sh


 After installation
 On the boot menu if only one Fedora was available, after rebooted new kernel called as NCTUns will be available

 before starting the GUI program
   Setting environment variables (only once)
   Then,
   change directory cd /usr/local/nctuns/bin 
   Starting up the dispatcher ./dispatcher
   Start up the coordinator ./coordinator
   Start up the nctunsclient  ./nctunsclient

 
 Modes of operation
   D E R P  
   Draw Edit Run Play

 Slect the operating mode
 
 Draw a Topology - default mode when NCTUns is launched
 Add devices, link, topology

 Wait - do jump the guns
 Edit Property mode - network topology can no longer be changed
   Instead, only devices’ properties (attributes) can be changed
   because if the network topology gets changed, attributes also should

 So to change the network topology, switch the mode back to the Draw Topology
 Then Edit Property mode, settings will be automatically generated and can be accessed by
   the GUI program

 Draw a Topology - select items from tool with left click and left click in the blank
   working area to add a item to the current network topology
   To add links between the nodes , Left-Click the link icon () from the toolbar to select 
     it
   Left -Click some node and hold the mouse button, Drag this link to the router,
     Then release the mouse left button on top of the router

 Save this network topology by choosing File > Save
   Save the topology file as "topologyName.tpl
