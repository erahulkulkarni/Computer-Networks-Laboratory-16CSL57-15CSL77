I. REQUIREMENT

 Software:

    1. OS Platform: Fedora 11 Linux (with gcc compiler installed) 
    2. X window system. (Gnome and KDE Desktop Environment are recommended.)
    3. Root privilege
    4. bash/tcsh assigned as the user's login shell (for command console 
       function)

    NOTE: You must be the root user to successfully run install.sh!

 Hardware:

    1. 256 MB RAM or more (512 MB recommended for running large-network cases) 
    2. 1.6 GHz Pentium PC or faster 
    3. 200 MB free disk space or more 
    4. Multi-core 32-bit PC can be supported. However, only one core will
       be used.
    5. 64-bit PC can be supported if it runs the 32-bit Fedora Linux system.

Application:

   1. An existing (e.g., BitTorrent) or to-be-developed real-life network 
      application can be run up on a host or router simulated by NCTUns to 
      participate in the simulation.
   2. However, such an application must not use busy-looping to wait for
      a certain event to occur. Instead, it must sometimes use sleep(), 
      usleep(), select(), etc. to release the CPU while waiting for an 
      event to occur.  Failure to do so will leave no CPU cycles for the
      NCTUns simulation engine and cause the entire Fedora system to freeze!

II. INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

    Please refer to INSTALL for the package installation procedure.

III. RUN THE PROGRAMS 

    1. Set three environment variables

        Before running all of the NCTUns 6.0 programs, three environment
        variables must be set.

        If you install the NCTUns 6.0 package into the default 
        /usr/local/nctuns directory, in the following description 
        ${where-you-install} should be replaced with /usr/local/nctuns.

        NCTUNSHOME should be set to ${where-you-install}, NCTUNS_TOOLS
        should be set to ${where-you-install}/tools, and NCTUNS_BIN
        should be set to ${where-you-install/bin

        E.g., if you use tcsh, you can add the following lines to your 
        .cshrc shell configuration file 

            setenv NCTUNSHOME ${where-you-install}
            setenv NCTUNS_TOOLS ${where-you-install}/tools
            setenv NCTUNS_BIN ${where-you-install}/bin

        E.g., if you use bash, you can add the following lines to your 
        .bashrc shell file 

            export NCTUNSHOME=${where-you-install}
            export NCTUNS_TOOLS=${where-you-install}/tools
            export NCTUNS_BIN=${where-you-install}/bin

	You can also use the ${where-you-install}/etc/nctuns.{csh|bash} to 
	help you set all environment variables

        E.g., if you use tcsh, you can add the following lines to your
        .cshrc shell configuration file

            source ${where-you-install}/etc/nctuns.csh

        E.g., if you use bash, you can add the following lines to your
        .bashrc shell configuration file

            source ${where-you-install}/etc/nctuns.bash

        If you do not add these commands to your .cshrc or .bashrc file, 
        you will need to manually set these variables in each opened
        xterm window before executing a NCTUns 6.0 program.

        Note that because the dispatcher and coordinator programs MUST be run 
	by the root user, the above environment settings must be added to the 
	ROOT user's shell file. As for the GUI program, it can be run by either
        a normal user or the root user. In case it is run by a normal user,
        the above settings should be added to that user's shell file.

    2. Specify the dispatcher's IP address
    
       You can open ${where-you-install}/etc/coordinator.cfg and 
       find the following line:

            "DISPATCHER_IP                 127.0.0.1"
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^
       On most machines, 127.0.0.1 is the default IP address assigned to 
       the loopback interface lo. As a result, this default setting should 
       work for the single-machine mode on most machines. If the lo 
       interface does not work properly on your machine (e.g., the 127.0.0.1 
       address may have not been automatically assgined to lo), you can 
       (1) manually assign 127.0.0.1 to lo0 by running the "ifconfig lo
       127.0.0.1" command, or (2) change the dispatcher IP address in this 
       file to your machine's own IP address (e.g., 140.113.17.5). 
       The effect is the same.

       If you would like to use the multi-machine mode, you should change 
       the IP address to the IP address of a remote dispatcher. 

    3. Now you can run up the dispatcher program, which is located at
       ${where-you-install}/bin/dispatcher. Note that, to run up the
       dispatcher program correctly, you MUST be the root user. 

    4. Now you can run up the coordinator program, which is located at
       ${where-you-install}/bin/coordinator. Note that, to run up the
       coordinator program correctly, you MUST be the root user.

    5. Finally, you can run up the GUI program, which is located at 
       ${where-you-install}/bin/nctunsclient. To run up the GUI program
       correctly, you can be either the root user or a normal user.

       However, for security reasons, in the GUI program's 
       G_Settings->Dispatcher dialog box, you are not allowed to enter and
       use the root account to submit and run a simulation job on 
       a (can be local or remote) simulation server. Instead, you need to 
       specify and use a normal user account/password such as nctuns/nctuns
       that has been created on that simulation server. 

    6. If you have some ip firewall settings on your machine, you must clean 
       up all rules before you run any simulation case. This is for correctly 
       using divert sockets in the kernel, which are needed in Mobile IP-related
       simulation cases. If after flushing all rules, you still encounter
       kernel panic problems when running these cases, it is recommended that
       you re-install a new Fedora and choose to disable the "Firewall" 
       option during the installation.
      
       You can use the following command to see your ip firewall settings:

            iptables -L

       You can use the following command to clean up all rules:

            iptables -F

       You can use the following command to stop iptables service:

            service iptables stop

    7. In Fedora, SELINUX is enabled by default. However, some 
       NCTUns daemons will run incorrectly with this option enabled. 
       The simplest way to fix this problem is to turn it off by setting 
       "SELINUX=disabled" in /etc/sysconfig/selinux.
